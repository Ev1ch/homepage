                                        ever
                                        been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross

                                        Romney.
                                        Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it!

                                                architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium
                                                is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York
                                                in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the
                                                Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for
